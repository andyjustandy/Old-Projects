Blackjack Game Simulator harnessed by Blackjack Strategy Discovery (Evolution) System.

Reasoning:

The Strategy Tester has been created as an application that will test new Blackjack strategies in a virtual simulation
 of games and then output a report on the performance. The Strategy Tester will then act as a simulation utility
 within the Strategy Discovery system, whereas the Strategy Discovery is a genetic algorithm and has been 
 created solely for the purpose of generating the good blackjack strategy. The end product of this 
 process will determine whether the creation of a 'perfect' blackjack strategy that surpasses all 
 existing strategies can be possible through the use of a Genetic Algorithm.


Using this system, can you create a top performing strategy?
